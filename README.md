## Prerequisites

We are expecting our students to have a basic knowlege of:
* calculus, especially matrix calculus, differentiation
* linear algebra
* probability theory and statistics
* programming, especially on Python

Although if you don't have any of this, you could substitude it with your diligence because the course provides additional materials to study requirements yourself.

## Materials for self-study

A lot of great materials are available online. See [extra_materials.md](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-mipt/blob/master/extra_materials.md) file for the whole list.

Informal "aggregation" of all topics by previous years students: [file](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-mipt/blob/master/ML_informal_notes.pdf) (in Russian) - useful for fast and furious exam passing.

Also lectures and seminars contains references to more detailed materials on topics.
